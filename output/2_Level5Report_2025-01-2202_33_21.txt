INTRODUCTION

Limeneal Wheel® is a Human Fulfilment Model, built on the science and philosophy of virtues to 
discover your Purpose, Passion, and Potential, manifested through 36 virtues and classified under 9 
unique dimensions.

Limeneal Wheel® is an intellectual proprietary work created and developed by Vivian Selvathurai 
Alfred, significantly influenced by the work on virtues by the 12th-century philosopher, Thomas 
Aquinas, and inspiration from ancient philosophers - Augustine of Hippo, Plato, Aristotle, and 
Thiruvalluvar, the 6th century philosopher from South India.

The word Limeneal is derived from the Latin word, “Limen” meaning “Gateway” and “Neal” in Sanskrit 
meaning “Champion”. Together, they indicate “Gateway of a Champion”.

The Limeneal Wheel® virtue mapper tool involves a proprietary virtues benchmarking process that 
compares degree of virtues required for a career or a job role with those expressed by individuals. 
Such comparison will then objectively demonstrate, an individual's inclination, effectiveness and 
fulfillment score.

“Where the roads of your Purpose, Passion and Potential meet, your True Calling is found.”

PURPOSE

PASSION

Is your guiding star

Is what lights your fire

POTENTIAL

Is what you can become

You need all 3 in right proportions vs. aspired 
career/role.

We help you to assess this so that not only you 
follow your purpose but have sufficient fire and
strengths to sustain it

Illustrative benchmark scores 
of two similar roles in an  
presented alongside

Virtues are required to a 
different degree in each role 
to achieve effectiveness and 
fulfilment.

When the degree of expression of potential (represented as 'virtues') of an 

individual, aligns with the degree of requirement of the virtues, in context of 

the high, moderate and significant tasks in a role, then it leads an individual 

to achieve effectiveness in their respective job role.

When an individual's Purpose, Passion & Potential align with the Job Role, 

fulfilment is achieved.

What is inclination: As per the Limeneal® theory, every 

individual expresses thoughts, feelings and actions in a fairly 

consistent manner. When observed closely, there are patterns 

emerging, that can be classified into various categories called 

Dimensions. A consistent display of top 3 Dimensions indicates 

an individual's inclination as per the Limeneal® theory.

Degree of inclination: When the 9 dimensions required as per a

job role are compared with those expressed by an individual - the

degree of inclination is determined.

* Note: The effectiveness score of each virtue is determined by :
(1) The virtue of prudence which works in conjunction with every other virtue. Any increase or decrease in the expression 

of prudence will have either a positive or negative impact on the effectiveness of that virtue. 

(2) Over expression of any virtue vs. required by the role leads to a counter productive impact on the outcome produced 
by an individual. Accordingly, such excessive expression is dealt with necessary moderation as per the Limeneal Wheel ®  
theory. Therefore, higher the expression of any virtue in excess of requirement, greater is the effectiveness gap.
